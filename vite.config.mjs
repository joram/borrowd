  special interplay between vite and django, but there doesn't
  seem to be a single value that can be used here that works for
  both vite dev and vite build.

  The issue seems to be the `url()` call used in the css to load in
  the font file. If set to "fonts", then dev works, but build can't
  find the target file. If set to "static/fonts" then build works,
  but oddly in dev, the path of the file is translated to
  "/static/static/fonts", which 404s.

  Hence, after much struggling and cursing, simply using the values
  here that work for each mode. */
